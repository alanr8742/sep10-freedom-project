    <h1>Banking</h1>
        <p>The Banking industry is really big and relates to finance so<br> therefore a lot of people will be involved in it<br>since it involves money. At the moment there is a lot of<br> techcnology out there that benefits banking, however there is a problem,<br> one of the inventions in banking which is the ATM machine<br> is too bulky and big so less of them are<br> placed at banks therefore increasing waiting lines at the Bank.<br> And i think that ATM's should be smaller and there is a way that I can make it smaller.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">ATM Machine</h5>
    <p class="card-text">One of the most modern technological innovations in Banking, it is primarily used to deposit or withdraw money from your bank account. First one of these to ever be installed at a bank was in London at the British Bank "Barclays". Proposed originally as a automatic teller machine. </p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Credit Cards</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Another innovation in the technological world and also an early one, primarily used to spend money. This is an interesting one because there's a lot that goes into this. For example, each credit card has a limit whether it is $10,000 or $15,000. And there is also a monthly payment that you have to make, this payment is depending on how much you spent on it for the month. And if you don't pay it then interest comes in and starts adding up on your next bill from the bank.</p>
