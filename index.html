    <h1>Banking</h1>
        <p>The Banking industry is really big and relates to finance so<br> therefore a lot of people will be involved in it<br>since it involves money. At the moment there is a lot of<br> techcnology out there that benefits banking, however there is a problem,<br> one of the inventions in banking which is the ATM machine<br> is too bulky and big so less of them are<br> placed at banks therefore increasing waiting lines at the Bank.<br> And i think that ATM's should be smaller and there is a way that I can make it smaller.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Credit Cards</h5>
    <p class="card-text">Another innovation in the technological world and also an early one, primarily used to spend money. This is an interesting one because there's a lot that goes into this. For example, each credit card has a limit whether it is $10,000 or $15,000. And there is also a monthly payment that you have to make, this payment is depending on how much you spent on it for the month. And if you don't pay it then interest comes in and starts adding up on your next bill from the bank.</p>

    <h5 class="card-title">ATM Machine</h5>
    <p class="card-text">One of the most modern technological innovations in Banking, it is primarily used to deposit or withdraw money from your bank account. First one of these to ever be installed at a bank was in London at the British Bank "Barclays". Proposed originally as a automatic teller machine. </p>

    <h5 class="card-title">Banking Apps</h5>
    <p class="card-text">The newest technological innovation out of these 3 mentioned, banking apps are one of the most convinient pieces of software for banking. They are very convinient because of all the things you are able to do with them, you are able to check your deposit history and your transaction history and you're even able to lock a credit or debit card incase it is vulerable to fraud. Another use for banking apps is that you are able to send money and pay bills through it without having to go to the recipients website and paying the money there. You can do it all within your banking app of choice which would comee down to who you bank with. For example, if you have a bank account with chase then it would mean that you would use their piece of software to manage your finances.</p>

  <h1>Possible Inventions</h1>
  <p>As the Banking industry already has a lot of technology it was quite hard to actually come up with a new invention never seen before,<br> soinstead of making a whole different invention that was never seen before<br> I decided to improve or reinvent already made inventions like the credit card<br> or the ATM machine and that is exactly what I did.<br>Starting off with the credit card<br>I decided to add a better security measure to it which was add a fingerprint biometric<br> and remove the pin number you would normally use at an atm or when you make a transaction.<br> What I tried doing was adding some sort of fingerprint scanner on the physical card and it would make a transaction after it recognized the fingerprint.<br> I think that it is a lot safer because people are able to guess your pin and can even lock your card because they would most<br> likely have many attempts at trying to withdraw money or make a transaction, but not everyone has the same fingerprint. Everyone has a different fingerprint.</p>
